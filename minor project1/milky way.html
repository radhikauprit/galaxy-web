      <p>  ilky Way[c] is the galaxy that includes the Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The Milky Way
        is a barred spiral galaxy with a D25 isophotal diameter estimated at 26.8 ± 1.1 kiloparsecs (87,400 ± 3,600 light-years),[10] but only about 1,000 light-years thick at the spiral arms (more at the bulge). Recent simulations suggest that a dark
        matter area, also containing some visible stars, may extend up to a diameter of almost 2 million light-years (613 kpc).[26][27] The Milky Way has several satellite galaxies and is part of the Local Group of galaxies, which form part of the Virgo
        Supercluster, which is itself a component of the Laniakea Supercluster.[28][29] It is estimated to contain 100–400 billion stars[30][31] and at least that number of planets. The Solar System is located at a radius of about 27,000 light-years (8.3
        kpc) from the Galactic Center,[34] on the inner edge of the Orion Arm, one of the spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust. The stars in the innermost 10,000 light-years form a bulge and one or more bars that radiate from the bulge. The Galactic
        Center is an intense radio source known as Sagittarius A*, a supermassive black hole of 4.100 (± 0.034) million solar masses.[35][36] The oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus probably formed shortly after
        the Dark Ages of the Big Bang.[37] Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe.[38]
        Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Doust Curtis,[39] observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies. Etymology and mythology Main articles: List of names for the
        Milky Way and Milky Way (mythology) In the Babylonian epic poem Enūma Eliš, the Milky Way is created from the severed tail of the primeval salt water dragoness Tiamat, set in the sky by Marduk, the Babylonian national god, after slaying her.[40][41]
        This story was once thought to have been based on an older Sumerian version in which Tiamat is instead slain by Enlil of Nippur,[42][43] but is now thought to be purely an invention of Babylonian propagandists with the intention to show Marduk
        as superior to the Sumerian deities.[43] In Greek mythology, Zeus places his son born by a mortal woman, the infant Heracles, on Hera's breast while she is asleep so the baby will drink her divine milk and become immortal. Hera wakes up while
        breastfeeding and then realizes she is nursing an unknown baby: she pushes the baby away, some of her milk spills, and it produces the band of light known as the Milky Way. In another Greek story, the abandoned Heracles is given by Athena to Hera
        for feeding, but Heracles' forcefulness causes Hera to rip him from her breast in pain.

        Llys Dôn (literally "The Court of Dôn") is the traditional Welsh name for the constellation Cassiopeia. At least three of Dôn's
                    children also have astronomical associations: Caer Gwydion ("The fortress of Gwydion") is the traditional Welsh name for the Milky Way,[47][48] and Caer Arianrhod ("The Fortress of Arianrhod") being the constellation of Corona Borealis.[49][50]
                    In western culture, the name "Milky Way" is derived from its appearance as a dim un-resolved "milky" glowing band arching across the night sky. The term is a translation of the Classical Latin via lactea, in turn derived from the Hellenistic
                    Greek γαλαξίας, short for γαλαξίας κύκλος (galaxías kýklos), meaning "milky circle". The Ancient Greek γαλαξίας (galaxias) – from root γαλακτ-, γάλα ("milk") + -ίας (forming adjectives) – is also the root of "galaxy", the name for
                    our, and later all such, collections of stars.[51][52][53] The Milky Way, or "milk circle", was just one of 11 "circles" the Greeks identified in the sky, others being the zodiac, the meridian, the horizon, the equator, the tropics
                    of Cancer and Capricorn, the Arctic Circle and the Antarctic Circle, and two colure circles passing through both poles.[54] Appearance The Milky Way as seen from a dark site with little light pollution The Milky Way is visible as a
                    hazy band of white light, some 30° wide, arching the night sky.[55] Although all the individual naked-eye stars in the entire sky are part of the Milky Way Galaxy, the term "Milky Way" is limited to this band of light.[56][57] The
                    light originates from the accumulation of unresolved stars and other material located in the direction of the galactic plane. Brighter regions around the band appear as soft visual patches known as star clouds. The most conspicuous
                    of these is the Large Sagittarius Star Cloud, a portion of the central bulge of the galaxy.[58] Dark regions within the band, such as the Great Rift and the Coalsack, are areas where interstellar dust blocks light from distant stars.
                    Peoples of the southern hemisphere, including the Inca and Australian aborigines, identified these regions as dark cloud constellations.[59] The area of sky that the Milky Way obscures is called the Zone of Avoidance.[60] The Milky
                    Way has a relatively low surface brightness. Its visibility can be greatly reduced by background light, such as light pollution or moonlight. The sky needs to be darker than about 20.2 magnitude per square arcsecond in order for the
                    Milky Way to be visible.[61] It should be visible if the limiting magnitude is approximately +5.1 or better and shows a great deal of detail at +6.1.[62] This makes the Milky Way difficult to see from brightly lit urban or suburban
                    areas, but very prominent when viewed from rural areas when the Moon is below the horizon.
                    
                    Maps of artificial night sky brightness show that more than one-third of Earth's population cannot see the Milky Way from their homes due
                    to light pollution.[63] As viewed from Earth, the visible region of the Milky Way's galactic plane occupies an area of the sky that includes 30 constellations.[e] The Galactic Center lies in the direction of Sagittarius, where the
                    Milky Way is brightest. From Sagittarius, the hazy band of white light appears to pass around to the galactic anticenter in Auriga. The band then continues the rest of the way around the sky, back to Sagittarius, dividing the sky into
                    two roughly equal hemispheres.[citation needed] The galactic plane is inclined by about 60° to the ecliptic (the plane of Earth's orbit). Relative to the celestial equator, it passes as far north as the constellation of Cassiopeia
                    and as far south as the constellation of Crux, indicating the high inclination of Earth's equatorial plane and the plane of the ecliptic, relative to the galactic plane. The north galactic pole is situated at right ascension 12h 49m,
                    declination +27.4° (B1950) near β Comae Berenices, and the south galactic pole is near α Sculptoris. Because of this high inclination, depending on the time of night and year, the Milky Way arch may appear relatively low or relatively
                    high in the sky. For observers from latitudes approximately 65° north to 65° south, the Milky Way passes directly overhead twice a day.[citation needed] Astronomical history See also: Galaxy § Observation history Ancient, naked eye
                    observations In Meteorologica, Aristotle (384–322 BC) states that the Greek philosophers Anaxagoras (c. 500–428 BC) and Democritus (460–370 BC) proposed that the Milky Way is the glow of stars not directly visible due to Earth's shadow,
                    while other stars receive their light from the Sun, but have their glow obscured by solar rays.[64] Aristotle himself believed that the Milky Way was part of the Earth's upper atmosphere, along with the stars, and that it was a byproduct
                    of stars burning that did not dissipate because of its outermost location in the atmosphere, composing its great circle. He said that the milky appearance of the Milky Way Galaxy is due to the refraction of the Earth's atmosphere.[65][66][67]
                    The Neoplatonist philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger (c. 495–570 AD) criticized this view, arguing that if the Milky Way were sublunary, it should appear different at different times and places on Earth, and that it should have parallax,
                    which it does not. In his view, the Milky Way is celestial. This idea would be influential later in the Muslim world.[68] The Persian astronomer Al-Biruni (973–1048) proposed that the Milky Way is "a collection of countless fragments
                    of the nature of nebulous stars".[69] The Andalusian astronomer Avempace (d 1138) proposed that the Milky Way was made up of many stars but appeared to be a continuous image in the Earth's atmosphere, citing his observation of a conjunction
                    of Jupiter and Mars in 1106 or 1107 as evidence.[66] The Persian astronomer Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (1201–1274) in his Tadhkira wrote: "The Milky Way, i.e. the Galaxy, is made up of a very large number of small, tightly clustered stars,
                    which, on account of their concentration and smallness, seem to be cloudy patches. Because of this, it was likened to milk in color.

                    Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (1292–1350) proposed that the Milky Way is "a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the fixed stars".[71] Telescopic observations The shape of the Milky Way as deduced from star counts by William Herschel in 1785.
                    The Solar System was assumed to be near the center Proof of the Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study the Milky Way and discovered that it is composed of a huge number of faint
                    stars. Galileo also concluded that the appearance of the Milky Way was due to refraction of the Earth's atmosphere.[72][73][65] In a treatise in 1755, Immanuel Kant, drawing on earlier work by Thomas Wright,[74] speculated (correctly)
                    that the Milky Way might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars, held together by gravitational forces akin to the Solar System but on much larger scales.[75] The resulting disk of stars would be seen as a band on the sky from
                    our perspective inside the disk. Wright and Kant also conjectured that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky might be separate "galaxies" themselves, similar to our own. Kant referred to both the Milky Way and the "extragalactic
                    nebulae" as "island universes", a term still current up to the 1930s.[76][77][78] The first attempt to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position of the Sun within it was carried out by William Herschel in 1785 by carefully
                    counting the number of stars in different regions of the visible sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the Milky Way with the Solar System close to the center.[79] In 1845, Lord Rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to
                    distinguish between elliptical and spiral-shaped nebulae. He also managed to make out individual point sources in some of these nebulae, lending credence to Kant's earlier conjecture.[80][81] Photograph of the "Great Andromeda Nebula"
                    from 1899, later identified as the Andromeda Galaxy In 1904, studying the proper motions of stars, Jacobus Kapteyn reported that these were not random, as it was believed in that time; stars could be divided into two streams, moving
                    in nearly opposite directions.[82] It was later realized that Kapteyn's data had been the first evidence of the rotation of our galaxy,[83] which ultimately led to the finding of galactic rotation by Bertil Lindblad and Jan Oort.[citation
                    needed] In 1917, Heber Doust Curtis had observed the nova S Andromedae within the Great Andromeda Nebula (Messier object 31). Searching the photographic record, he found 11 more novae. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average,
                    10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred within the Milky Way.

                    As a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150,000 parsecs. He became a proponent of the "island universes" hypothesis, which held that the spiral nebulae were independent galaxies.[84][85] In 1920 the Great Debate took place between
                    Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the Universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula is an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of
                    dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the Milky Way, as well as the significant Doppler shift.[86] The controversy was conclusively settled by Edwin Hubble in the early 1920s using the Mount Wilson observatory 2.5 m (100 in) Hooker
                    telescope. With the light-gathering power of this new telescope, he was able to produce astronomical photographs that resolved the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars. He was also able to identify
                    some Cepheid variables that he could use as a benchmark to estimate the distance to the nebulae. He found that the Andromeda Nebula is 275,000 parsecs from the Sun, far too distant to be part of the Milky Way.[87][88] Satellite observations
                    Map of stars cataloged by the Gaia release in 2021, displayed as density mesh in the diagram The ESA spacecraft Gaia provides distance estimates by determining the parallax of a billion stars and is mapping the Milky Way with four
                    planned releases of maps in 2016, 2018, 2021 and 2024.[89][90] Data from Gaia has been described as "transformational". It has been estimated that Gaia has expanded the number of observations of stars from about 2 million stars as
                    of the 1990s to 2 billion. It has expanded the measurable volume of space by a factor of 100 in radius and a factor of 1,000 in precision.[91] A study in 2020 concluded that Gaia detected a wobbling motion of the galaxy, which might
                    be caused by "torques from a misalignment of the disc's rotation axis with respect to the principal axis of a non-spherical halo, or from accreted matter in the halo acquired during late infall, or from nearby, interacting satellite
                    galaxies and their consequent tides".[92] In April 2024, initial studies (and related maps) involving the magnetic fields of the Milky Way were reported.[93] Astrography Sun's location and neighborhood See also: Location of Earth Map
                    of stars cataloged by the Gaia release in 2021, overlay on top of artist's conception of the Milky Way overall shape The Sun is near the inner rim of the Orion Arm, within the Local Fluff of the Local Bubble, between the Radcliffe
                    wave and Split linear structures (formerly Gould Belt).[94] Based upon studies of stellar orbits around Sgr A* by Gillessen et al. (2016), the Sun lies at an estimated distance of 27.14 ± 0.46 kly (8.32 ± 0.14 kpc)[34] from the Galactic
                    Center. Boehle et al. (2016) found a smaller value of 25.64 ± 0.46 kly (7.86 ± 0.14 kpc), also using a star orbit analysis.[95] The Sun is currently 5–30 parsecs (16–98 ly) above, or north of, the central plane of the Galactic disk.[96]
                    The distance between the local arm and the next arm out, the Perseus Arm, is about 2,000 parsecs (6,500 ly).[97] The Sun, and thus the Solar System, is located in the Milky Way's galactic habitable zone.[98][99] There are about 208
                    stars brighter than absolute magnitude 8.5 within a sphere with a radius of 15 parsecs (49 ly) from the Sun, giving a density of one star per 69 cubic parsecs, or one star per 2,360 cubic light-years (from List of nearest bright stars).
                    On the other hand, there are 64 known stars (of any magnitude, not counting 4 brown dwarfs) within 5 parsecs (16 ly) of the Sun, giving a density of about one star per 8.2 cubic parsecs, or one per 284 cubic light-years (from List
                    of nearest stars). This illustrates the fact that there are far more faint stars than bright stars: in the entire sky, there are about 500 stars brighter than apparent magnitude 4 but 15.5 million stars brighter than apparent magnitude
                    14.[100] The apex of the Sun's way, or the solar apex, is the direction that the Sun travels through space in the Milky Way. The general direction of the Sun's Galactic motion is towards the star Vega near the constellation of Hercules,
                    at an angle of roughly 60 sky degrees to the direction of the Galactic Center. The Sun's orbit about the Milky Way is expected to be roughly elliptical with the addition of perturbations due to the Galactic spiral arms and non-uniform
                    mass distributions. In addition, the Sun passes through the Galactic plane approximately 2.7 times per orbit.[101] [unreliable source?] This is very similar to how a simple harmonic oscillator works with no drag force (damping) term.
                    These oscillations were until recently thought to coincide with mass lifeform extinction periods on Earth.[102] A reanalysis of the effects of the Sun's transit through the spiral structure based on CO data has failed to find a correlation.[103]
                    It takes the Solar System about 240 million years to complete one orbit of the Milky Way (a galactic year),[104] so the Sun is thought to have completed 18–20 orbits during its lifetime and 1/1250 of a revolution since the origin of
                    humans. The orbital speed of the Solar System about the center of the Milky Way is approximately 220 km/s (490,000 mph) or 0.073% of the speed of light. The Sun moves through the heliosphere at 84,000 km/h (52,000 mph). At this speed,
                    it takes around 1,400 years for the Solar System to travel a distance of 1 light-year, or 8 days to travel 1 AU (astronomical unit).[105] The Solar System is headed in the direction of the zodiacal constellation Scorpius, which follows

                    Galactic quadrants Main article: Galactic quadrant A diagram of the Sun's location in the Milky Way, the angles represent longitudes in the galactic coordinate system A galactic quadrant, or quadrant of the Milky Way, refers to one of four circular sectors
                    in the division of the Milky Way. In astronomical practice, the delineation of the galactic quadrants is based upon the galactic coordinate system, which places the Sun as the origin of the mapping system.[107] Quadrants are described
                    using ordinals – for example, "1st galactic quadrant",[108] "second galactic quadrant",[109] or "third quadrant of the Milky Way".[110] Viewing from the north galactic pole with 0° (zero degrees) as the ray that runs starting from
                    the Sun and through the Galactic Center, the quadrants are: Galactic quadrant Galactic longitude (ℓ) Reference 1st 0° ≤ ℓ ≤ 90° [111] 2nd 90° ≤ ℓ ≤ 180° [109] 3rd 180° ≤ ℓ ≤ 270° [110] 4th 270° ≤ ℓ ≤ 360° (360° ≅ 0°) [108] with the
                    galactic longitude (ℓ) increasing in the counter-clockwise direction (positive rotation) as viewed from north of the Galactic Center (a view-point several hundred thousand light-years distant from Earth in the direction of the constellation
                    Coma Berenices); if viewed from south of the Galactic Center (a view-point similarly distant in the constellation Sculptor), ℓ would increase in the clockwise direction (negative rotation). Size and mass Size A size comparison of the

                    the isophotal diameter is not well understood.[11] It is estimated that the significant bulk of stars in the galaxy lies within the 26 kiloparsecs (80,000 light-years) diameter, and that the number of stars beyond the outermost disc
                    dramatically reduces to a very low number, with respect to an extrapolation of the exponential disk with the scale length of the inner disc.[112][11] There are several methods being used in astronomy in defining the size of a galaxy,
                    and each of them can yield different results with respect to one another. The most commonly employed method is the D25 standard – the isophote where the photometric brightness of a galaxy in the B-band (445 nm wavelength of light,
                    in the blue part of the visible spectrum) reaches 25 mag/arcsec2.[113] An estimate from 1997 by Goodwin and others compared the distribution of Cepheid variable stars in 17 other spiral galaxies to the ones in the Milky Way, and modelling
                    the relationship to their surface brightnesses. This gave an isophotal diameter for the Milky Way at 26.8 ± 1.1 kiloparsecs (87,400 ± 3,600 light-years), by assuming that the galactic disc is well represented by an exponential disc
                    and adopting a central surface brightness of the galaxy (µ0) of 22.1±0.3 B-mag/arcsec−2 and a disk scale length (h) of 5.0 ± 0.5 kpc (16,300 ± 1,600 ly).[114][10][115] This is significantly smaller than the Andromeda Galaxy's isophotal
                    diameter, and slightly below the mean isophotal sizes of the galaxies being at 28.3 kpc (92,000 ly).

                    The paper concludes that the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxy were not overly large spiral galaxies and as well as one of the largest known (if the former not being the largest) as previously widely believed, but rather average ordinary spiral galaxies.[116]
                    To compare the relative physical scale of the Milky Way, if the Solar System out to Neptune were the size of a US quarter (24.3 mm (0.955 in)), the Milky Way would be approximately at least the greatest north–south line of the contiguous
                    United States.[117] An even older study from 1978 gave a lower diameter for Milky Way about 23 kpc (75,000 ly).[10] A 2015 paper discovered that there is a ring-like filament of stars called Triangulum–Andromeda Ring (TriAnd Ring)
                    rippling above and below the relatively flat galactic plane, which alongside Monoceros Ring were both suggested to be primarily the result of disk oscillations and wrapping around the Milky Way, at a diameter of at least 50 kpc (160,000
                    ly),[118] which may be part of the Milky Way's outer disk itself, hence making the stellar disk larger by increasing to this size.[119] A more recent 2018 paper later somewhat ruled out this hypothesis, and supported a conclusion that
                    the Monoceros Ring, A13 and TriAnd Ring were stellar overdensities rather kicked out from the main stellar disk, with the velocity dispersion of the RR Lyrae stars found to be higher and consistent with halo membership.[120] Another
                    2018 study revealed the very probable presence of disk stars at 26–31.5 kpc (84,800–103,000 ly) from the Galactic Center or perhaps even farther, significantly beyond approximately 13–20 kpc (40,000–70,000 ly), in which it was once
                    believed to be the abrupt drop-off of the stellar density of the disk, meaning that few or no stars were expected to be above this limit, save for stars that belong to the old population of the galactic halo.[11][121][122] A 2020 study
                    predicted the edge of the Milky Way's dark matter halo being around 292 ± 61 kpc (952,000 ± 199,000 ly), which translates to a diameter of 584 ± 122 kpc (1.905 ± 0.3979 Mly).[26][27] The Milky Way's stellar disk is also estimated to
                    be approximately up to 1.35 kpc (4,000 ly) thick.[123][124] Mass A schematic profile of the Milky Way. Abbreviations: GNP/GSP: Galactic North and South Poles The Milky Way is approximately 890 billion to 1.54 trillion times the mass
                    of the Sun in total (8.9×1011 to 1.54×1012 solar masses),[7][8][9] although stars and planets make up only a small part of this. Estimates of the mass of the Milky Way vary, depending upon the method and data used. The low end of the
                    estimate range is 5.8×1011 solar masses (M☉), somewhat less than that of the Andromeda Galaxy.[125][126][127] Measurements using the Very Long Baseline Array in 2009 found velocities as large as 254 km/s (570,000 mph) for stars at
                    the outer edge of the Milky Way.[128] Because the orbital velocity depends on the total mass inside the orbital radius, this suggests that the Milky Way is more massive, roughly equaling the mass of Andromeda Galaxy at 7×1011 M☉ within
                    160,000 ly (49 kpc) of its center.[129] In 2010, a measurement of the radial velocity of halo stars found that the mass enclosed within 80 kiloparsecs is 7×1011 M☉.[130] In a 2014 study, the mass of the entire Milky Way is estimated
                    to be 8.5×1011 M☉,[131] but this is only half the mass of the Andromeda Galaxy.[131] A recent 2019 mass estimate for the Milky Way is 1.29×1012 M☉.[132] Much of the mass of the Milky Way seems to be dark matter, an unknown and invisible
                    form of matter that interacts gravitationally with ordinary matter. A dark matter halo is conjectured to spread out relatively uniformly to a distance beyond one hundred kiloparsecs (kpc) from the Galactic Center. Mathematical models
                    of the Milky Way suggest that the mass of dark matter is 1–1.5×1012 M☉.[133][134][135] 2013 and 2014 studies indicate a range in mass, as large as 4.5×1012 M☉[136] and as small as 8×1011 M☉.[137] By comparison, the total mass of all
                    the stars in the Milky Way is estimated to be between 4.6×1010 M☉[138] and 6.43×1010 M☉.

                    <p>In addition to the stars, there is also interstellar gas, comprising 90% hydrogen and 10% helium by mass,[139] [unreliable source?] with
                    two thirds of the hydrogen found in the atomic form and the remaining one-third as molecular hydrogen.[140] The mass of the Milky Way's interstellar gas is equal to between 10%[140] and 15%[139] of the total mass of its stars. Interstellar
                    dust accounts for an additional 1% of the total mass of the gas.[139] In March 2019, astronomers reported that the virial mass of the Milky Way Galaxy is 1.54 trillion solar masses within a radius of about 39.5 kpc (130,000 ly), over
                    twice as much as was determined in earlier studies, suggesting that about 90% of the mass of the galaxy is dark matter.[7][8] In September 2023, astronomers reported that the virial mass of the Milky Way Galaxy is only 2.06 1011 solar
                    masses, only a 10th of the mass of previous studies. The mass was determined from data of the Gaia spacecraft.[141] Contents The Milky Way contains between 100 and 400 billion starsand at least that many planets.An exact figure would
                    depend on counting the number of very-low-mass stars, which are difficult to detect, especially at distances of more than 300 ly (90 pc) from the Sun. As a comparison, the neighboring Andromeda Galaxy contains an estimated one trillion
                    (1012) stars.[143] The Milky Way may contain ten billion white dwarfs, a billion neutron stars, and a hundred million stellar black holes.[f][146][147] Filling the space between the stars is a disk of gas and dust called the interstellar
                    medium. This disk has at least a comparable extent in radius to the stars,[148] whereas the thickness of the gas layer ranges from hundreds of light-years for the colder gas to thousands of light-years for warmer gas.[149][150] The
                    disk of stars in the Milky Way does not have a sharp edge beyond which there are no stars. Rather, the concentration of stars decreases with distance from the center of the Milky Way. For reasons that are not understood, beyond a radius
                    of roughly 40,000 light years (13 kpc) from the center, the number of stars per cubic parsec drops much faster with radius.[112] Surrounding the galactic disk is a spherical galactic halo of stars and globular clusters that extends
                    farther outward, but is limited in size by the orbits of two Milky Way satellites, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, whose closest approach to the Galactic Center is about 180,000 ly (55 kpc).[151] At this distance or beyond,
                    the orbits of most halo objects would be disrupted by the Magellanic Clouds. Hence, such objects would probably be ejected from the vicinity of the Milky Way. The integrated absolute visual magnitude of the Milky Way is estimated to
                    be around −20.9.[152][153][g] Both gravitational microlensing and planetary transit observations indicate that there may be at least as many planets bound to stars as there are stars in the Milky Way,[32][154] and microlensing measurements
                    indicate that there are more rogue planets not bound to host stars than there are stars.[155][156] The Milky Way contains at least one planet per star, resulting in 100–400 billion planets, according to a January 2013 study of the
                    five-planet star system Kepler-32 by the Kepler space observatory.[33] A different January 2013 analysis of Kepler data estimated that at least 17 billion Earth-sized exoplanets reside in the Milky Way.[157] ll
