        <p>his article is about the astronomical structure. For Earth's galaxy, see Milky Way. For other uses, see Galaxy (disambiguation). NGC 4414, a typical spiral galaxy in the constellation Coma Berenices, is about 55,000 light-years in diameter and
            approximately 60 million light-years from Earth. A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity.[1][2] The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky',
            a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars,[3] range in size from dwarfs with less than a thousand stars,[4] to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred
            trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. <br> Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are
            a common feature at the centres of galaxies. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical,[5] spiral, or irregular.[6] Many are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers. The Milky Way's central
            black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun.[7] It is estimated that there are between 200 billion[8] ( to 2 trillion[9] galaxies in the observable universe. Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs
            in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 light years) and are separated by distances on the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs). For comparison, the Milky Way has a diameter of at least 26,800 parsecs (87,400 ly) and is separated
            from the Andromeda Galaxy (with diameter of about 152,000 ly), its nearest large neighbor, by 780,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly.) The space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) with an average density of less
            than one atom per cubic meter. Most galaxies are gravitationally organized into groups, clusters and superclusters. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which it dominates along with the Andromeda Galaxy. The group is part of the Virgo
            Supercluster.

            <br>At the largest scale, these associations are generally arranged into sheets and filaments surrounded by immense voids.[10] Both the Local Group and the Virgo Supercluster are contained in a much larger cosmic structure named Laniakea.[11]
            Etymology The word galaxy was borrowed via French and Medieval Latin from the Greek term for the Milky Way, galaxías (kúklos) γαλαξίας (κύκλος)[12][13] 'milky (circle)', named after its appearance as a milky band of light in the sky. In Greek
            mythology, Zeus places his son born by a mortal woman, the infant Heracles, on Hera's breast while she is asleep so the baby will drink her divine milk and thus become immortal. Hera wakes up while breastfeeding and then realizes she is nursing
            an unknown baby: she pushes the baby away, some of her milk spills, and it produces the band of light known as the Milky Way.[14][15] In the astronomical literature, the capitalized word "Galaxy" is often used to refer to the Milky Way galaxy,
            to distinguish it from the other galaxies in the observable universe. The English term Milky Way can be traced back to a story by Geoffrey Chaucer c. 1380: See yonder, lo, the Galaxyë Which men clepeth the Milky Wey, For hit is whyt. — Geoffrey
            Chaucer, The House of Fame[13] Galaxies were initially discovered telescopically and were known as spiral nebulae. Most 18th- to 19th-century astronomers considered them as either unresolved star clusters or anagalactic nebulae, and were just
            thought of as a part of the Milky Way, but their true composition and natures remained a mystery. Observations using larger telescopes of a few nearby bright galaxies, like the Andromeda Galaxy, began resolving them into huge conglomerations
            of stars, but based simply on the apparent faintness and sheer population of stars, the true distances of these objects placed them well beyond the Milky Way. For this reason they were popularly called island universes, but this term quickly
            fell into disuse, as the word universe implied the entirety of existence. Instead, they became known simply as galaxies.[16] Nomenclature Galaxy cluster SDSS J1152+3313. SDSS stands for Sloan Digital Sky Survey, J for Julian epoch, and 1152+3313
            for right ascension and declination respectively. Millions of galaxies have been catalogued, but only a few have well-established names, such as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Magellanic Clouds, the Whirlpool Galaxy, and the Sombrero Galaxy. Astronomers
            work with numbers from certain catalogues, such as the Messier catalogue, the NGC (New General Catalogue), the IC (Index Catalogue), the CGCG (Catalogue of Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies), the MCG (Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies),
            the UGC (Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies), and the PGC (Catalogue of Principal Galaxies, also known as LEDA). All the well-known galaxies appear in one or more of these catalogs but each time under a different number. For example, Messier
            109 (or "M109") is a spiral galaxy having the number 109 in the catalog of Messier. It also has the designations NGC 3992, UGC 6937, CGCG 269–023, MCG +09-20-044, and PGC 37617 (or LEDA 37617), among others.[17] Millions of fainter galaxies
            are known by their identifiers in sky surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.[18] Observation history Milky Way Main article: Milky Way Greek philosopher Democritus (450–370 BCE) proposed that the bright band on the night sky known as
            the Milky Way might consist of distant stars.[19] Aristotle (384–322 BCE), however, believed the Milky Way was caused by "the ignition of the fiery exhalation of some stars that were large, numerous and close together" and that the "ignition
            takes place in the upper part of the atmosphere, in the region of the World that is continuous with the heavenly motions."[20] Neoplatonist philosopher Olympiodorus the Younger (c. 495–570 CE) was critical of this view, arguing that if the
            Milky Way was sublunary (situated between Earth and the Moon) it should appear different at different times and places on Earth, and that it should have parallax, which it did not. In his view, the Milky Way was celestial.

            <br> [21] According to Mohani Mohamed, Arabian astronomer Ibn al-Haytham made the first attempt at observing and measuring the Milky Way's parallax,[22] and he thus "determined that because the Milky Way had no parallax, it must be remote
            from the Earth, not belonging to the atmosphere."[23] Persian astronomer al-Biruni proposed the Milky Way galaxy was "a collection of countless fragments of the nature of nebulous stars."[24] Andalusian astronomer Avempace (d. 1138) proposed
            that it was composed of many stars that almost touched one another, and appeared to be a continuous image due to the effect of refraction from sublunary material,[20][25] citing his observation of the conjunction of Jupiter and Mars as evidence
            of this occurring when two objects were near.[20] In the 14th century, Syrian-born Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya proposed the Milky Way galaxy was "a myriad of tiny stars packed together in the sphere of the fixed stars."[26] Actual proof of the
            Milky Way consisting of many stars came in 1610 when the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to study it and discovered it was composed of a huge number of faint stars.[27][28] In 1750, English astronomer Thomas Wright, in
            his An Original Theory or New Hypothesis of the Universe, correctly speculated that it might be a rotating body of a huge number of stars held together by gravitational forces, akin to the Solar System but on a much larger scale, and that
            the resulting disk of stars could be seen as a band on the sky from a perspective inside it.[29][30] In his 1755 treatise, Immanuel Kant elaborated on Wright's idea about the Milky Way's structure.[31] The shape of the Milky Way as estimated
            from star counts by William Herschel in 1785; the Solar System was assumed to be near the center. The first project to describe the shape of the Milky Way and the position of the Sun was undertaken by William Herschel in 1785 by counting the
            number of stars in different regions of the sky. He produced a diagram of the shape of the galaxy with the Solar System close to the center.[32][33] Using a refined approach, Kapteyn in 1920 arrived at the picture of a small (diameter about
            15 kiloparsecs) ellipsoid galaxy with the Sun close to the center. A different method by Harlow Shapley based on the cataloguing of globular clusters led to a radically different picture: a flat disk with diameter approximately 70 kiloparsecs
            and the Sun far from the center.[30] Both analyses failed to take into account the absorption of light by interstellar dust present in the galactic plane; but after Robert Julius Trumpler quantified this effect in 1930 by studying open clusters,
            the present picture of the Milky Way galaxy emerged.[34] Distinction from other nebulae A few galaxies outside the Milky Way are visible on a dark night to the unaided eye, including the Andromeda Galaxy, Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic
            Cloud, and the Triangulum Galaxy. In the 10th century, Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi made the earliest recorded identification of the Andromeda Galaxy, describing it as a "small cloud".[35] In 964, he probably mentioned the Large
            Magellanic Cloud in his Book of Fixed Stars (referring to "Al Bakr of the southern Arabs",[36] since at a declination of about 70° south it was not visible where he lived); it was not well known to Europeans until Magellan's voyage in the
            16th century.[37][36] The Andromeda Galaxy was later independently noted by Simon Marius in 1612.[35] In 1734, philosopher Emanuel Swedenborg in his Principia speculated that there might be other galaxies outside that were formed into galactic
            clusters that were minuscule parts of the universe that extended far beyond what could be seen. These views "are remarkably close to the present-day views of the cosmos."[38] In 1745, Pierre Louis Maupertuis conjectured that some nebula-like
            objects were collections of stars with unique properties, including a glow exceeding the light its stars produced on their own, and repeated Johannes Hevelius's view that the bright spots were massive and flattened due to their rotation.

            <br>[39] In 1750, Thomas Wright correctly speculated that the Milky Way was a flattened disk of stars, and that some of the nebulae visible in the night sky might be separate Milky Ways.[30][40] Photograph of the "Great Andromeda Nebula" by
            Isaac Roberts, 1899, later identified as the Andromeda Galaxy Toward the end of the 18th century, Charles Messier compiled a catalog containing the 109 brightest celestial objects having nebulous appearance. Subsequently, William Herschel
            assembled a catalog of 5,000 nebulae.[30] In 1845, Lord Rosse constructed a new telescope and was able to distinguish between elliptical and spiral nebulae.[41] In 1912, Vesto M. Slipher made spectrographic studies of the brightest spiral
            nebulae to determine their composition. Slipher discovered that the spiral nebulae have high Doppler shifts, indicating that they are moving at a rate exceeding the velocity of the stars he had measured. He found that the majority of these
            nebulae are moving away from us.[42][43] In 1917, Heber Doust Curtis observed nova S Andromedae within the "Great Andromeda Nebula" (as the Andromeda Galaxy, Messier object M31, was then known). Searching the photographic record, he found
            11 more novae. Curtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred within this galaxy. As a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 150,000 parsecs. He became a proponent of the
            so-called "island universes" hypothesis, which holds that spiral nebulae are actually independent galaxies.[44] In 1920 a debate took place between Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis (the Great Debate), concerning the nature of the Milky Way,
            spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the universe. To support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula is an external galaxy, Curtis noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in the Milky Way, as well as the significant
            Doppler shift.[45] In 1922, the Estonian astronomer Ernst Öpik gave a distance determination that supported the theory that the Andromeda Nebula is indeed a distant extra-galactic object.[46] Using the new 100-inch Mt. Wilson telescope, Edwin
            Hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables, thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far too distant to be part of
            the Milky Way.[47] In 1926 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology that is used to this day.[48][49] Modern research Rotation curve of spiral galaxy Messier 33 (yellow and blue points with error bars), and a predicted one from
            distribution of the visible matter (gray line).

            <br> The discrepancy between the two curves can be accounted for by adding a dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy.[50] In 1944, Hendrik van de Hulst predicted that microwave radiation with wavelength of 21 cm would be detectable from interstellar
            atomic hydrogen gas;[51] and in 1951 it was observed. This radiation is not affected by dust absorption, and so its Doppler shift can be used to map the motion of the gas in this galaxy. These observations led to the hypothesis of a rotating
            bar structure in the center of this galaxy.[52] With improved radio telescopes, hydrogen gas could also be traced in other galaxies. In the 1970s, Vera Rubin uncovered a discrepancy between observed galactic rotation speed and that predicted
            by the visible mass of stars and gas. Today, the galaxy rotation problem is thought to be explained by the presence of large quantities of unseen dark matter.[53][54] Beginning in the 1990s, the Hubble Space Telescope yielded improved observations.
            Among other things, its data helped establish that the missing dark matter in this galaxy could not consist solely of inherently faint and small stars.[55] The Hubble Deep Field, an extremely long exposure of a relatively empty part of the
            sky, provided evidence that there are about 125 billion (1.25×1011) galaxies in the observable universe.[56] Improved technology in detecting the spectra invisible to humans (radio telescopes, infrared cameras, and x-ray telescopes) allows
            detection of other galaxies that are not detected by Hubble. Particularly, surveys in the Zone of Avoidance (the region of sky blocked at visible-light wavelengths by the Milky Way) have revealed a number of new galaxies.[57] A 2016 study
            published in The Astrophysical Journal, led by Christopher Conselice of the University of Nottingham, used 20 years of Hubble images to estimate that the observable universe contained at least two trillion (2×1012) galaxies.[58][59] However,
            later observations with the New Horizons space probe from outside the zodiacal light reduced this to roughly 200 billion (2×1011).[60][61] Types and morphology See also: Galactic bulge, Central massive object, Active galactic nucleus, and
            Galaxy morphological classification Types of galaxies according to the Hubble classification scheme : an E indicates a type of elliptical galaxy; an S is a spiral; and SB is a barred spiral galaxy Galaxies come in three main types: ellipticals,
            spirals, and irregulars. A slightly more extensive description of galaxy types based on their appearance is given by the Hubble sequence. Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual morphological type (shape), it may miss certain
            important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies.[6] Many galaxies are thought to contain a supermassive black hole at their center. This includes the Milky
            Way, whose core region is called the Galactic Center.[62] Ellipticals Main article: Elliptical galaxy The Hubble classification system rates elliptical galaxies on the basis of their ellipticity, ranging from E0, being nearly spherical, up
            to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an ellipsoidal profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar
            matter.
